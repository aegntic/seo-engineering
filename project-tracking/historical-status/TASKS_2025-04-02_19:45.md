## April 2, 2025 Update Notes

Today we successfully implemented the JavaScript Error Detection module, which represents a significant enhancement to our technical SEO capabilities. The module uses Playwright to identify, categorize, and provide actionable recommendations for JavaScript errors that affect website performance and user experience.

Key achievements:
- Created a sophisticated JavaScript error detection system
- Implemented 12 distinct error categories with pattern matching
- Added user interaction simulation to trigger potential issues
- Built mobile-specific error checking capabilities
- Designed a comprehensive scoring mechanism
- Developed detailed reporting with actionable recommendations
- Created thorough documentation and testing tools

The implementation is fully integrated with our technical SEO module and ready for use in client websites. This represents our first completed task in Phase 2, with a focus now shifting to broken link identification and advanced SEO score calculation.
