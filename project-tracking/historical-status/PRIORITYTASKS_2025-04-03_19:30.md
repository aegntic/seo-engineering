## Progress Update (April 3, 2025 at 19:30)

We've successfully completed the Internal Linking Optimization system, marking significant progress in our Phase 2 enhancement work. This sophisticated module provides comprehensive analysis and optimization of website internal linking structures with four key components:

1. **Link Graph Analysis**: Built link graph construction and sophisticated algorithms to analyze site structure
2. **Orphaned Page Detection**: Created system to identify disconnected content and recommend connecting pages
3. **Link Distribution Optimizer**: Developed intelligent algorithms to balance link equity across the site
4. **Anchor Text Optimization**: Implemented advanced system to recommend optimal anchor text

The system is fully integrated with our existing modules and ready for production use. It includes graph theory algorithms, performance optimizations for large websites, and comprehensive documentation.

Our focus now shifts to enhancing the Client Dashboard to effectively visualize all the data and insights generated by our various analysis modules, providing clients with an intuitive interface to understand and act on our recommendations.
