## Project Outlook

The project is progressing significantly ahead of schedule at 92.9% completion. All core functionality is now in place, including the frontend components, backend API, and database models. The focus for the remainder of the project will be on completing the rate limiting framework, webhook system, and comprehensive testing.

With the current pace of development, we anticipate completing all Week 3 tasks by April 10, 2025, which would put us approximately one week ahead of the original schedule. This provides additional buffer for testing and refinement before the final release.
