|------|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| A/B Testing Framework | 20% | 30% | 40% | 10% |
| Test Suite for Automation | 0% | 20% | 30% | 50% |
| Competitor Analysis System | 10% | 30% | 50% | 10% |
| Optimize Crawler | 0% | 30% | 60% | 10% |

## Expected Outcomes

Completing these priority tasks will:

1. Enable data-driven SEO decision making through A/B testing
2. Improve reliability of automated systems through comprehensive testing
3. Allow competitive analysis to identify new opportunities
4. Enhance system performance for large-scale deployments

These components together form the next layer of functionality that transforms SEOAutomate from a technical fix platform to a comprehensive SEO strategy tool that drives measurable business outcomes.

## Progress Update (April 4, 2025 at 16:30)

We've successfully completed the Mobile Optimization Checks module, a significant component in our Week 2 refinement phase. This robust module provides comprehensive analysis of mobile-specific SEO factors with four key components:

1. **Viewport Configuration Analysis**: Implemented scanning for proper viewport meta tags and settings
2. **Touch Element Validation**: Created system to verify that touch targets are properly sized and spaced
3. **Responsive Design Testing**: Built framework to test websites across various device sizes and breakpoints
4. **Mobile Performance Measurement**: Developed tools to measure Core Web Vitals and other mobile metrics

The Mobile Optimization module integrates with our existing SEO analysis infrastructure and provides comprehensive reporting with specific recommendations. With mobile-first indexing being standard in search engines, this module significantly enhances our ability to identify and fix critical mobile SEO issues.

Our focus now shifts to implementing the A/B Testing Framework, which will allow us to systematically test and validate SEO changes based on statistical analysis rather than assumptions.
