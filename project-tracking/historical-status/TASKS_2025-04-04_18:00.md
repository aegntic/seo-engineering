## Next Implementation Milestone

The next major milestone is completing the A/B Testing Framework, which will enable data-driven SEO optimization through systematic testing of changes. This framework will build upon the completed Mobile Optimization System and integrate with the existing Fix Implementation and Verification modules to create a comprehensive optimization loop:

1. Identify issues (Technical SEO + Mobile Optimization)
2. Implement fixes (Fix Implementation)
3. Create variants (A/B Testing)
4. Measure performance (Verification + A/B Testing)
5. Implement winning solutions (Automated Implementation)

This milestone is essential for demonstrating ROI to clients through statistically significant performance improvements.
