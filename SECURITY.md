# Security Policy

Even the most confident projects have their moments of doubt. We take security seriously, even if we sometimes feel a bit *insecure* about it all. This policy outlines how we handle potential vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions (The Ones We Feel Less Anxious About)

Like people, software versions need ongoing support to feel their best. Here's which versions are currently receiving security updates (think of them as confidence boosters):

| Version | Supported?          | Notes                                    |
| :------ | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| 5.1.x   | ✅                  | Actively receiving reassurance patches.  |
| 5.0.x   | ❌                  | Feeling a bit exposed, please upgrade. |
| 4.8.x   | ✅                  | Still getting support, but getting older. |
| < 4.0   | ❌                  | Left to face its insecurities alone.     |

## Reporting a Vulnerability (Pointing Out Our Insecurities)

Think you've found a chink in our armor? A reason for us to feel *vulnerable*? We appreciate you letting us know privately so we can address our *insecurities* before they're widely known.

**How to Tell Us We're Exposed:**

1.  **Please report suspected vulnerabilities to:** `[Your Security Contact Email or Reporting Link Here - e.g., security@example.com or a GitHub Security Advisory]`
2.  **Don't Panic (We'll Try Not To):** We know reporting issues can be stressful. Please provide detailed steps to reproduce the *insecurity*. The more information you give us, the less *uncertain* we'll be.
3.  **Managing Expectations (and Anxiety):** We aim to acknowledge your report within `[e.g., 48 hours]`. We'll investigate the potential *weak spot* and let you know if we accept the vulnerability (validating your concerns!) or decline it (sometimes it's just *imposter syndrome* on our part, or not a true flaw). We'll do our best to keep you updated on our progress as we work on a patch to restore our confidence.

Thanks for helping us build a more secure (and less *anxious*) project!
