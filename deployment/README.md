# SEOAutomate Deployment System

This directory contains a modular deployment system for SEOAutomate, designed to facilitate seamless deployment in both development and production environments.

## System Architecture

The deployment system follows a modular approach, with each component serving a specific function in the deployment pipeline:

```
deployment/
├── deploy.sh                # Core deployment script
├── docker-compose.prod.yml  # Production container orchestration
├── generate-credentials.sh  # Credential generation module
├── nginx.conf               # Nginx reverse proxy configuration
├── verify-credentials.sh    # Credential verification module
└── README.md                # This documentation file
```

Additionally, at the root level:
- `deploy-manager.sh`: Master orchestration script providing interactive deployment management

## Module Components

### Core Components

1. **Credential Management Module**
   - `generate-credentials.sh`: Securely generates and validates all required credentials
   - `verify-credentials.sh`: Verifies credential integrity and validates external service connectivity

2. **Infrastructure Management Module**
   - `docker-compose.prod.yml`: Defines the containerized architecture for production deployment
   - `nginx.conf`: Implements secure reverse proxy configuration with SSL termination

3. **Deployment Orchestration Module**
   - `deploy.sh`: Executes the deployment sequence with environment-specific optimizations
   - `deploy-manager.sh`: Provides a unified interface for deployment management

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start

1. **Interactive Deployment**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-manager.sh
   ```
   This launches an interactive menu system for deployment management.

2. **Direct Deployment**
   ```bash
   # For development
   ./deployment/deploy.sh
   
   # For production
   ./deployment/deploy.sh --prod
   ```

3. **Credential Generation**
   ```bash
   ./deployment/generate-credentials.sh
   ```

## Security Considerations

- All credentials are generated with cryptographically secure methods
- SSL/TLS termination is enforced for all production traffic
- Protected routes implement HTTP Basic Authentication
- Non-root container execution for service components
- Volume isolation for persistent data
- Log rotation to prevent information leakage

## Production Deployment Sequence

The production deployment follows this sequence:

1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Prerequisite validation
   - Environment variable configuration
   - SSL certificate installation

2. **Infrastructure Provisioning**
   - Network configuration
   - Volume creation
   - Container image building

3. **Service Deployment**
   - Database initialization
   - Service container orchestration
   - Reverse proxy configuration

4. **Verification**
   - Health check validation
   - Credential verification
   - Connectivity testing

5. **Post-Deployment Configuration**
   - Monitoring setup
   - Backup schedule implementation
   - Initial admin user creation

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Container startup failures**
   - Check logs: `docker-compose logs [service_name]`
   - Verify environment variables in `.env.production`
   - Ensure ports are not already in use

2. **SSL/TLS issues**
   - Verify certificate paths in Nginx configuration
   - Ensure certificates are properly formatted
   - Check certificate expiration dates

3. **Database connectivity problems**
   - Verify MongoDB credentials
   - Check database initialization status
   - Ensure database ports are accessible

## Further Customization

The modular design allows for component-level customization:

- Modify `nginx.conf` to adjust reverse proxy behavior
- Update `docker-compose.prod.yml` to change service configurations
- Enhance `generate-credentials.sh` to support additional integration points
