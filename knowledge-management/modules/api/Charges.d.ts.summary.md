     * The `Charge` object represents a single attempt to move money into your Stripe account.
     * PaymentIntent confirmation is the most common way to create Charges, but transferring
     * money to a different Stripe account through Connect also creates Charges.
     * Some legacy payment flows create Charges directly, which is not recommended for new integrations.
