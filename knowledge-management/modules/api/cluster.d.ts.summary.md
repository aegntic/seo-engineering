/**
 * Clusters of Node.js processes can be used to run multiple instances of Node.js
 * that can distribute workloads among their application threads. When process isolation
 * is not needed, use the [`worker_threads`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/worker_threads.html)
 * module instead, which allows running multiple application threads within a single Node.js instance.

 * server ports.
