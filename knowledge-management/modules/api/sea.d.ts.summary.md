/**
 * This feature allows the distribution of a Node.js application conveniently to a
 * system that does not have Node.js installed.
 *
 * Node.js supports the creation of [single executable applications](https://github.com/nodejs/single-executable) by allowing
 * the injection of a blob prepared by Node.js, which can contain a bundled script,
 * into the `node` binary. During start up, the program checks if anything has been
 * injected. If the blob is found, it executes the script in the blob. Otherwise
 * Node.js operates as it normally does.
