/**
 * Encodes all characters in the input using HTML entities. This includes
 * characters that are valid ASCII characters in HTML documents, such as `#`.
 *
 * To get a more compact output, consider using the `encodeNonAsciiHTML`
 * function, which will only encode characters that are not valid in HTML
 * documents, as well as non-ASCII characters.
 *
 * If a character has no equivalent entity, a numeric hexadecimal reference
 * (eg. `&#xfc;`) will be used.
