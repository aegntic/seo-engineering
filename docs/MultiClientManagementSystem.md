# Multi-Client Management System

## Architecture Overview

The Multi-Client Management System is designed as a scalable, hierarchical structure that enables agencies to manage multiple clients efficiently through a unified interface. This document outlines the core components, data models, and functionality of the system.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Models

#### Agency
- Represents a partner agency using the platform
- Contains agency-level settings, branding, and subscription details
- Serves as the parent entity for all clients and users

#### Client
- Represents an individual client being managed by an agency
- Contains client-specific data such as website, SEO metrics, and issue tracking
- Can be assigned to specific agency users

#### AgencyUser
- Represents users within the agency ecosystem (staff and client users)
- Contains user authentication and permission information
- Can be assigned to specific clients based on role

#### Role
- Defines permission sets that can be assigned to users
- Supports both system-defined and custom roles
- Granular permissions for different feature areas

### 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture

The system implements a multi-tenant architecture with robust data isolation:

- Each agency operates in an isolated environment
- Data is partitioned by agency ID in all models
- Database queries filter by agency to ensure proper data isolation
- Role-based permission system for access control within agencies

### 3. User Hierarchy

The system supports a hierarchical user structure:

```
Agency
  ├── Admin Users (full access)
  ├── Manager Users (limited admin access)
  ├── Specialist Users (technical access)
  ├── Viewer Users (read-only access)
  └── Client Users (client-specific access)
```

### 4. Permission Framework

The permission system is granular and role-based:

- System-defined roles (Admin, Manager, Specialist, Viewer, Client)
- Custom roles with configurable permissions
- Permission categories (dashboard, reports, settings, clients, users, billing)
- Individual permissions (view, edit, create, delete) for each category

## Key Features

### Agency Dashboard
- Overview of all managed clients
- Agency-level performance metrics
- Quick actions for common tasks

### Client Management
- Comprehensive client list with filtering and search
- Individual client dashboards with detailed metrics
- Client assignment to agency team members

### White Label System
- Custom branding (logo, colors, favicon)
- Custom domain support
- Branded email communication
- Branded reports and documents

### User Permission Management
- Role-based access control
- Custom role creation
- User invitation and management
- Client-specific user assignments

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The database schema implements proper relationships between entities:

```
Agency (1) ---< Client (n)
Agency (1) ---< AgencyUser (n)
Agency (1) ---< Role (n)
Client (n) ---< AgencyUser (n)  [many-to-many]
Role (1) ---< AgencyUser (n)
```

### API Architecture

The API implements proper separation of concerns:

- Controllers handle request/response logic
- Services contain business logic
- Models define data structure and validation
- Middleware handles authentication and permission checks

### Security Considerations

The system implements several security measures:

- Data isolation between agencies
- Role-based access control
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT authentication with proper expiration
- Input validation and sanitization

## Future Enhancements

1. **Hierarchical Client Grouping**
   - Support for organizing clients into groups or categories

2. **Advanced Billing Features**
   - Client-specific billing rates
   - Automated invoicing based on services

3. **Team Collaboration Tools**
   - Task assignment and tracking
   - Internal notes and communication

4. **White Label Enhancements**
   - Custom report templates
   - Advanced theme customization

5. **API Access Management**
   - Agency-specific API keys
   - Usage tracking and rate limiting
