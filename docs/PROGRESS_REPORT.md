# SEO.engineering MVP Progress Report

## Executive Summary

We've made significant progress on the SEO.engineering MVP, focusing on establishing the foundation for the platform. Our work has concentrated on three key areas: database schema design, API specification development, and frontend implementation with a completed landing page.

## Key Accomplishments

### Database Design
- ✅ Created comprehensive MongoDB schema for all core entities:
  - User model for authentication and account management
  - Client model for managing website information and configurations
  - Report model for storing SEO audit results
  - SEO Check model for defining available tests and their parameters

### API Development
- ✅ Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User authentication and management
  - Client creation and configuration
  - Scan initiation, monitoring, and scheduling
  - Report generation and retrieval
  - Issue management and automatic fixing

### Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Completed responsive landing page with:
  - Modern, professional design
  - Feature showcase sections
  - How-it-works process explanation
  - Testimonials display
  - Pricing table with toggle between monthly/annual

### Architecture & Infrastructure
- ✅ Established clear modular architecture following project guidelines
- ✅ Set up proper folder structure for maintainability and scalability

## Metrics

| Category | Completed | Total Planned | Progress |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Week 1 Tasks | 9 | 21 | 42.9% |
| Planning & Architecture | 3 | 5 | 60% |
| Core Automation | 2 | 5 | 40% |
| Website Development | 4 | 7 | 57.1% |

## Next Steps

1. **Technical SEO Checks Module**
   - Implement core checks (page speed, meta tags, mobile-friendliness)
   - Create analysis engine for issue prioritization

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Complete user registration and login system
   - Implement JWT token management and secure routes

3. **Client Dashboard**
   - Develop main dashboard interface
   - Create visualization components for SEO metrics
   - Implement client site management screens

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test API endpoints with frontend components
   - Verify database interactions for data integrity

## Roadblocks & Challenges

- Need to establish proper webhook communication between n8n workflows and our API
- Must determine the best approach for implementing automatic fixes via git
- Need to develop a robust error handling system for failed scans

## Resource Allocation Update

We're currently on track with our planned resource allocation:
- Frontend: 30% (4 developers)
- Automation: 40% (5 developers)
- Backend/API: 20% (3 developers)
- Testing/Documentation: 10% (1 developer)

## Conclusion

The SEO.engineering MVP is progressing well, with 42.9% of Week 1 tasks completed and 16.1% of the overall project complete. Our focus on establishing a solid foundation with proper architecture, database design, and API specifications will enable faster implementation of remaining features. The completed landing page provides a clear vision of the product and will be valuable for early demo purposes.

The next phase will focus on completing the technical SEO checks module, authentication flow, and client dashboard, which will bring us to a functional MVP that can be tested with early users.
