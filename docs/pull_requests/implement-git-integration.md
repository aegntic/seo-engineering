# Implement Git Integration for Tracking Changes

## Description

This PR implements the Git integration module for tracking and managing changes made to client websites by the SEO.engineering platform. This is a critical component that enables the Implementation Module to safely apply and track changes with full versioning and rollback capabilities.

## Changes Made

- Created a comprehensive Git wrapper for interacting with Git CLI
- Implemented a change tracking system with support for batched changes
- Added metadata storage for each change with detailed information
- Developed a REST API for interacting with the Git functionality
- Added rollback capability for reverting changes when needed
- Implemented comprehensive logging for Git operations
- Created unit and integration tests for the Git integration module
- Added detailed documentation for the implementation

## Files Changed

- Added `automation/git-integration/git-wrapper.js`
- Added `automation/git-integration/change-tracker.js`
- Added `automation/git-integration/index.js`
- Added `automation/git-integration/tests/git-integration.test.js`
- Added `api/src/controllers/git.controller.js`
- Added `api/src/routes/git.routes.js`
- Added `api/src/utils/logger.js`
- Added `api/src/config.js`
- Added `docs/Git_Integration_Implementation.md`
- Updated `TASKS.md`

## Testing Done

- Unit tests for the GitWrapper class
- Integration tests for the ChangeTracker class
- End-to-end tests for the entire Git integration workflow
- API endpoint tests with mock requests and responses
