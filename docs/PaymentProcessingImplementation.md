# Payment Processing Implementation

## Overview

The payment processing system has been implemented using Stripe as the payment processor. This implementation provides a complete solution for handling subscriptions, one-time payments, and payment method management.

## Components Implemented

### Backend (API)

1. **Models**:
   - `Payment.js`: Schema for storing subscription and payment information
   - Updated `user.model.js`: Added payment-related fields (stripeCustomerId, plan, isSubscribed, planFeatures)

2. **Controller**:
   - `paymentController.js`: Handles all payment-related operations:
     - Customer creation
     - Subscription management (create, update, cancel)
     - Payment method management
     - Payment intent creation
     - Webhook handling for Stripe events

3. **Routes**:
   - `paymentRoutes.js`: Exposes RESTful endpoints for payment operations:
     - `/api/payments/create-customer`
     - `/api/payments/create-subscription`
     - `/api/payments/subscription/:userId`
     - `/api/payments/subscription/:subscriptionId` (PUT/DELETE)
     - `/api/payments/create-payment-intent`
     - `/api/payments/webhook`

4. **Server Configuration**:
   - Updated `server.js` to include payment routes
   - Added special middleware for handling Stripe webhooks
   - Updated documentation to include payment endpoints

### Frontend (Website)

1. **Context**:
   - `PaymentContext.jsx`: Provides payment functionality to the application:
     - Subscription management
     - Payment method operations
     - Pricing information

2. **Components**:
   - `CheckoutForm.jsx`: Handles credit card input and subscription creation
   - `PaymentMethodForm.jsx`: Manages payment method addition and updates
   - `SubscriptionManager.jsx`: Displays and manages user subscriptions
   - `PricingTable.jsx`: Displays pricing plans with toggle between monthly/yearly

3. **Pages**:
   - `PaymentSettingsPage.jsx`: Dashboard page for managing payment settings:
     - Subscription management
     - Payment method management
     - Billing history

4. **App Updates**:
   - Updated routing to include the payment settings page
   - Added context providers to the application wrapper

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Added Stripe-related environment variables:
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: For backend API
     - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: For webhook verification
     - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: For frontend Stripe integration

2. **Dependencies Added**:
   - Backend: `stripe`
   - Frontend: `@stripe/react-stripe-js`, `@stripe/stripe-js`

## Features Implemented

1. **Subscription Management**:
   - Three-tiered pricing (Basic, Professional, Enterprise)
   - Monthly and yearly billing options
   - Subscription creation, updating, and cancellation
   - Subscription status tracking

2. **Payment Processing**:
   - Secure credit card handling via Stripe Elements
   - Payment method storage and management
   - One-time payment capability

3. **Webhook Integration**:
   - Automated handling of subscription lifecycle events
   - Invoice tracking and management
   - Payment failure handling

## Testing Instructions

1. Create a Stripe account and obtain API keys
2. Set the environment variables in `.env` files
3. Set up a webhook endpoint in the Stripe dashboard pointing to your API's `/api/payments/webhook` endpoint
4. Create Stripe Products and Prices that match your pricing tiers
5. Update the priceId variables in the code with your actual Stripe Price IDs

## Security Considerations

1. All sensitive payment information is handled directly by Stripe
2. Payment information is never stored in our database
3. Webhook signatures are verified to prevent spoofing
4. All payment routes are protected by authentication middleware (except webhooks)

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement coupons and promotional codes
2. Add usage-based billing for specific features
3. Implement invoicing and receipt generation
4. Add support for multiple payment methods per user
5. Create an admin interface for managing subscriptions
