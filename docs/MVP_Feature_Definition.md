## Decision Criteria

The following criteria were used to determine the MVP feature set:

1. **Core Value Delivery**: Does the feature directly contribute to the core value proposition of automating technical SEO?
2. **Implementation Complexity**: Can the feature be implemented within the Phase 1 timeframe?
3. **User Need Criticality**: Is the feature essential for users to achieve their primary goals?
4. **Competitive Differentiation**: Does the feature help differentiate from existing solutions?
5. **Foundation Building**: Does the feature establish necessary infrastructure for future enhancements?

Features that scored highly across these criteria were included in the MVP, while others were deferred to later phases.

## Release Strategy

## Feature Deferral Process

If any MVP features need to be deferred due to time constraints or technical challenges, the following process will be followed:

1. Identify the at-risk feature and assess impact on core value proposition
2. Determine if a simplified version of the feature can be implemented instead
3. If deferral is necessary, document the decision and update the roadmap
4. Communicate the change to stakeholders
5. Prioritize the deferred feature for the next release cycle

## Feature Success Metrics

Each feature category will be measured against the following success metrics:

### MVP Core & Extended
- **User Adoption**: Percentage of users actively using the feature
- **Time Savings**: Hours saved compared to manual processes
- **Issue Resolution**: Percentage of identified issues successfully resolved
- **User Satisfaction**: Feature-specific satisfaction ratings

### Post-MVP Features
- **Upgrade Rate**: Percentage of users upgrading to access new features
- **Feature Usage**: Frequency and depth of feature usage
- **Revenue Impact**: Additional revenue generated from the feature
- **Competitive Win Rate**: Impact on competitive win/loss ratio

## Conclusion

This MVP definition provides a clear roadmap for SEO.engineering's initial release and future development. By focusing on core technical SEO automation features in the MVP, we can deliver immediate value to users while establishing a foundation for more advanced capabilities in subsequent releases.
