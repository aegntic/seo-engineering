- **Custom Extensions:** Plugin architecture for custom functionality

## Disaster Recovery

The system implements several disaster recovery mechanisms:

- **Automatic Backups:** Regular backups of all system data
- **Version Control:** Git-based tracking of all changes allows for rollbacks
- **High Availability:** Redundant components to prevent single points of failure
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Early detection of issues
- **Runbooks:** Documented procedures for recovery from common failure scenarios

## Future Architecture Considerations

The following architecture enhancements are planned for future versions:

- **Edge Computing:** Distribution of crawling and analysis to edge locations
- **AI Enhancements:** Advanced machine learning for issue detection and prioritization
- **Serverless Components:** Transition of suitable components to serverless architecture
- **Multi-Region Deployment:** Geographical distribution for improved performance
- **Enhanced Analytics:** Advanced analytics with real-time insights
