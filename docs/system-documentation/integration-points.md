11. Dashboard updates to show analysis results

### Issue Fix Flow

1. User selects issues to fix through the Client Dashboard
2. Dashboard sends fix request to the Implementation Module API
3. Implementation Module publishes `implementation.started` event
4. Implementation Module creates implementation job in the `implementations` collection
5. If approval is required, Implementation Module publishes `implementation.approvalRequired` event
6. User approves implementation through the Dashboard
7. Dashboard sends approval to the Implementation Module API
8. Implementation Module publishes `implementation.approved` event
9. Implementation Module executes fixes and stores changes in the `changes` collection
10. Implementation Module publishes `implementation.completed` event
11. Verification System receives the event and initiates verification
12. Verification System publishes `verification.started` event
13. Verification System verifies the changes and stores results in the `verifications` collection
14. Verification System publishes `verification.completed` event
15. Reporting Engine receives the event and generates a report
16. Reporting Engine publishes `report.generated` event
17. Dashboard updates to show implementation and verification results

## Integration Authorization

All integration points are protected by appropriate authorization mechanisms:

1. **API Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for API requests
2. **API Authorization**: Role-based access control for API endpoints
3. **Event Authorization**: Event consumers verify event authenticity
4. **Database Authorization**: MongoDB role-based access control

## Error Handling

Integration points implement the following error handling strategies:

1. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient failures
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Default behaviors when dependencies are unavailable
4. **Detailed Error Responses**: Meaningful error messages for troubleshooting
5. **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for monitoring

## Integration Monitoring

The following metrics are collected for integration monitoring:

1. **API Latency**: Response time for API calls
2. **API Error Rate**: Percentage of API calls that result in errors
3. **Event Processing Time**: Time to process received events
4. **Event Delivery Time**: Time from event publish to consumption
5. **Database Query Performance**: Query execution time
6. **Integration Health**: Overall health status of each integration point

## Integration Versioning

All integration points follow semantic versioning:

1. **Major Version**: Breaking changes that require updates to consumers
2. **Minor Version**: Non-breaking additions to the interface
3. **Patch Version**: Bug fixes that don't change the interface

## Integration Testing

Integration points are verified through the following testing strategies:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between pairs of components
3. **Contract Tests**: Verify adherence to interface contracts
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows across all components
5. **Performance Tests**: Verify performance characteristics under load
6. **Chaos Tests**: Verify resilience to failures

## Documentation Guidelines

When modifying integration points, follow these documentation guidelines:

1. Update this document with any interface changes
2. Provide example request/response pairs for API changes
3. Document any new events or event field changes
4. Update database schema documentation for collection changes
5. Update sequence diagrams for workflow changes
6. Notify all affected component teams
