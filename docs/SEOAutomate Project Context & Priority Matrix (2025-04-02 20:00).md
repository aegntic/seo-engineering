## Module Integration Framework

All modules follow these integration protocols:
- REST APIs for synchronous operations
- Event-based messaging for asynchronous operations
- Git for version-controlled changes to client sites
- WebSockets for real-time updates to dashboard

## Golden Rules Reference

1. All files under 500 lines for modularity
2. Use markdown for project management
3. Focus on one task per message
4. Start fresh conversations frequently
5. Be specific in requests
6. Test all code
7. Write clear documentation and comments
8. Implement environment variables securely

## Initialization Sequence

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/organization/SEO.engineering.git

# Install dependencies
cd SEO.engineering
npm install

## Progress Update (April 2, 2025 at 20:00)

Today we successfully implemented the JavaScript Error Detection module, completing the first task of our Phase 2 enhancement work. The module provides comprehensive detection and analysis of JavaScript errors that affect website performance and user experience. It's fully integrated with our technical SEO module and ready for use in client websites.

Key achievements:
- Created a sophisticated error detection system with Playwright
- Implemented 12 distinct error categories through pattern matching
- Added simulated user interactions to trigger potential JavaScript issues
- Built mobile-specific error checking capabilities
- Designed a comprehensive scoring and reporting system
- Created thorough documentation and testing tools

Our focus now shifts to implementing the Broken Link Identification and Advanced SEO Score Calculation modules, which will further enhance our technical SEO capabilities and analytics system.
